# Traffic Simulation
A traffic simulation (an application of cellular automata) to optimize roads applied to the city I lived in at the time (Hyderabad, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³). 

As I have learned in the past two months, traffic in Hyderabad, and India more generally, is no joke. Despite the enormous amount of vehicles on the streets, the traffic seems to rarely ever stop flowing. The motivation behind this paper is to analyze one of the main roads in Kondapur, the neighborhood where I live.

# Technologies and Lessons

The technologies I used in this project are:
- Python
- Python matplotlib, random, and numpy libraries

Concepts I learned and practices are:
- Data visualization (complex visualizations of a simulation through time)
- Empirical and theoretical analysis of a model
- Data collection
- Modeling
